![HumanAIze Logo](https://i.imgur.com/y9vLUyy.png)

A modern web application for real-time waste classification using artificial intelligence. The project uses two machine learning models to detect and classify objects into different waste categories.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 Real-time detection through webcam
- 🤖 Two AI models available:
  - COCO-SSD for real-time detection
  - Roboflow for static image analysis
- 🎯 Accurate classification into 6 categories:
  - 🌱 BIODEGRADABLE
  - 📄 PAPER
  - 🥤 PLASTIC
  - 🔧 METAL
  - 📦 CARDBOARD
  - 🍷 GLASS
- 💫 Modern UI with glassmorphism effects
- 📸 Camera mode with animations
- 🎨 Responsive and engaging design

## 🚀 Demo

The application can:
- Detect objects in real-time
- Automatically classify materials
- Provide visual feedback with colored borders
- Show confidence percentages
- Capture and analyze static images

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Animations, Flexbox, Grid)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- TensorFlow.js (COCO-SSD)
- Roboflow API
- Axios for API calls

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dean988/garbage-classification-humanaize.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd garbage-classification-humanaize
```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser

⚠️ **Note**: AI models are not included in the repository due to size constraints. To get access to the models, please contact me privately.

## 💻 Usage

1. Grant webcam access when prompted
2. Select your desired model:
   - COCO-SSD: for real-time detection
   - Roboflow: for single image analysis
3. For COCO-SSD:
   - Click "Start Detection" to begin
   - Show objects to the webcam
   - The system will classify automatically
4. For Roboflow:
   - Click "Take Photo"
   - Wait for the countdown
   - Analysis will be performed automatically

## 🎨 Customization

The system is highly customizable:
- Modify confidence thresholds in `app.js`
- Add new categories in the materials mapping
- Customize colors in the classification system
- Modify animations in `styles.css`
